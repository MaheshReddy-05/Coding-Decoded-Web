# 2225 - Find Players With Zero or One Losses (Medium)

## Problem Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-players-with-zero-or-one-losses/

## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `matches` where `matches[i] = [winneri, loseri]` indicates that the player `winneri` defeated player `loseri` in a match.

Return _a list_ `answer` _of size_ `2` _where:_

* `answer[0]` is a list of all players that have **not** lost any matches.
* `answer[1]` is a list of all players that have lost exactly **one** match.

The values in the two lists should be returned in **increasing** order.

**Note:**

* You should only consider the players that have played **at least one** match.
* The testcases will be generated such that **no** two matches will have the **same** outcome.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: matches = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,6],[5,6],[5,7],[4,5],[4,8],[4,9],[10,4],[10,9]]
Output: [[1,2,10],[4,5,7,8]]
Explanation:
Players 1, 2, and 10 have not lost any matches.
Players 4, 5, 7, and 8 each have lost one match.
Players 3, 6, and 9 each have lost two matches.
Thus, answer[0] = [1,2,10] and answer[1] = [4,5,7,8].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: matches = [[2,3],[1,3],[5,4],[6,4]]
Output: [[1,2,5,6],[]]
Explanation:
Players 1, 2, 5, and 6 have not lost any matches.
Players 3 and 4 each have lost two matches.
Thus, answer[0] = [1,2,5,6] and answer[1] = [].
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= matches.length <= 10^5`
* `matches[i].length == 2`
* `1 <= winneri, loseri <= 10^5`
* `winneri != loseri`
* All `matches[i]` are **unique**.

## Approach 1: Hash Map

Check the number of times to lose for each player. If it is $$0$$, then this player belongs to $$ans[0]$$. If it is $$1$$, then it belongs to $$ans[1]$$.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> findWinners(vector<vector<int>>& matches) {
        vector<vector<int>> ans(2);
        unordered_map<int, int> lost;
        // calculate lost matches
        for (auto x : matches) {
            if (!lost.count(x[0])) lost[x[0]] = 0;
            if (!lost.count(x[1])) lost[x[1]] = 0;
            lost[x[1]]++;
        }
        // categorise players
        for (auto x : lost) {
            int who = x.first, lostMatches = x.second;
            if (lostMatches == 0) ans[0].push_back(who);
            else if (lostMatches == 1) ans[1].push_back(who);
        }
        // the values in the two lists should be returned in increasing order 
        sort(ans[0].begin(), ans[0].end());
        sort(ans[1].begin(), ans[1].end());
        return ans;
    }
};
```
